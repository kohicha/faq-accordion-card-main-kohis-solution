## Overview

This one is my favorite project so far, I learned alot in terms of layout. Although right now the dropdown is not as smooth, but I still had to finish this to be consistent with my goal (which is completing atleast one frontend mentor challenge everyday.).

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
